### Goal III: Students are proficient in the theory and application of skills essential for knowledge representation in evolving technology environments, in any chosen area of specialization.

## Goal III(a). 
Students analyze, organize, and describe various formats of information objects.

<p><b>LIS 6726 Metadata (Elective Course).</b><br/><a href="https://eoroyal26.github.io/assets/pdf/BIBFRAME_Initiatives_ROYAL_v4.pdf" target="blank">Descriptive Metadata Plan: Benjamin Franklin Papers</a></p>

With a Descriptive Metadata Plan, I aimed to describe metadata fields, describe metadata creation, and organize the data with a directory for the Benjamin Franklin Papers at the Library of Congress. This artifact is an essential tool for creating a metadata scheme because it clearly identifies a specific metadata standard and scheme to ensure a high degree of structure, organization and accessibility. Furthermore, I was keenly aware of the various formats of the collection because the Descriptive Metadata Plan also creates clear processes and procedures to optimally store, locate, and display records and archival objects.


## Goal III(b). 
Students identify and apply best practices in the use of different technologies for knowledge representation.

<p><b>LIS 6711 Organization of Knowledge I (Core Course).</b><br/><a href="https://eoroyal26.github.io/assets/pdf/BIBFRAME_Initiatives_ROYAL_v4.pdf" target="blank">Research Assignment: Latest Developments on BIBFRAME Initiatives</a></p>

I aimed to recognize and employ best practices for linked data through this brief research paper exploring the latest developments of the Bibliographic Framework (BIBFRAME) initiative. As implemented through the BIBFRAME initiative, linked data is an important technology for the organization and interoperability of data because it utilizes Web 2.0 technologies to link web information with information isolated within library systems. Therefore, libraries will be able to link their special collections to web platforms throughout the world. While this technology has developed in an incremental manner, institutions are accelerating the development of BIBFRAME initiatives to cultivate the benefits of this exciting technology for libraries and information organizations.
