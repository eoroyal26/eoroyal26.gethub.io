### Co-curricular activities includes artifacts and examples that were completed outside the 39-credit hour MLIS program.

<p><b>1. Certificate of Completion: The American Association of Law Libraries.</b><br/><a href="https://eoroyal26.github.io/assets/pdf/AALL-2021_Virtual-Conference.pdf" target="blank">AALL 2021 Virtual Conference</a></p>

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the American Association of Law Libraries (AALL) offered their annual meeting and conference virtually. This decision provided me the opportunity to attend the “Leading with Wisdom and Insight” conference to engage law librarians and legal information professionals on current topics impacting law librarianship. “The Future of Library Collections,” “Leading an ILS Migration,” and “Library Infrastructure 101: Technical Services’ Role in Building Your Public Services Foundation and Bridges to Patron Success” were the highlights of the conference.

<p><b>2. Certificate of Participation: The Southeast Florida Library Information Network.</b><br/><a href="https://eoroyal26.github.io/assets/pdf/SEFLIN-2020_Virtual-Conference.pdf" target="blank">SEFLIN 2020 Virtual Conference</a></p>

The Southeast Florida Library Information Network (SEFLIN) offered six continuing education credit hours for the 2020 Virtual Conference. Consequently, this conference showcased topics relating to how gaming theory, privacy, ethics, access, communication theories, experiential workplaces, trends, transformations, and innovation affects libraries. Artificial intelligence and augmented reality were some of the highlights from the conference.

In “RDA: Now & to the Future” webinar, Robin Fay (Cataloger and Trainer) explores the development of the Resource Description & Access (RDA) within the context of cataloging and metadata. Through this two-hour webinar, Fay outlines the evolution of cataloging from Machine Readable Cataloging (MARC) records from the 1960s to the semantic web, the internet of things (IoT), artificial intelligence. Overall, these developments that creates information connections through linking, instead of duplication. Because of exponential change in information technology, a committee of librarians implemented the RDA as a revision the Anglo-American Cataloging Rules Second Edition) to better respond to the semantic web, adapt to multiple resources and neutral to cataloging formats. RDA also embraces the concept, philosophy and vision of data modeling as outlined by the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) or the Library Reference Model.

As an ideal companion piece to the “RDA: Now & to the Future” webinar, “Linking the Data: Metadata & Linked Data” webinar explores the utilization of a linked data strategy with metadata. In addition to outlining the current implementation of linked data and metadata within libraries, the webinar also investigates possible future applications of linked data and metadata within various domains and sectors. Because linked data aims to integrate library records into the semantic web, libraries can engage with individuals through the internet. With libraries having a comprehensive internet presence, libraries can connect individuals to their special collections with linked metadata.
