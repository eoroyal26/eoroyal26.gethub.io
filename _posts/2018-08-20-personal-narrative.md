## My Personal and Professional Journey

To reflect student learning outcomes, I have utilized these outcomes to organize the artifacts within my e-Portfolio.  These student learning outcomes are significant because they encapsulate the learning objectives of the Master of Library and Information Science (MLIS) and the core competencies of the American Library Association. In addition, the artifacts trace my progress and ultimate completion of the 39 credit MLIS program. While simplicity, in design and user interface, is my objective in creating this e-Portfolio, I also want to create a e-Portfolio that communicates my professional development through color selection, design principles, and branding. In addition, I have utilized a GitHub template to build my working e-Portfolio during the first half of the MLIS program. Towards the second half of the MLIS program, I seize this opportunity to practice front-end web development to create a final e-Portfolio.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll(19) also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
- Insert YouTube Video Presentation
{% endhighlight %}
