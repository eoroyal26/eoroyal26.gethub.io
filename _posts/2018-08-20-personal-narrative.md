## My Personal and Professional Journey

### Introduction

To reflect student learning outcomes, I have utilized these outcomes to organize the artifacts within my e-Portfolio.  These student learning outcomes are significant because they encapsulate the learning objectives of the Master of Library and Information Science (MLIS) and the core competencies of the American Library Association. In addition, the artifacts trace my progress and ultimate completion of the 39 credit MLIS program. While simplicity, in design and user interface, is my objective in creating this e-Portfolio, I also want to create a e-Portfolio that communicates my professional development through color selection, design principles, and branding. In addition, I have utilized a GitHub template to build my working e-Portfolio during the first half of the MLIS program. Towards the second half of the MLIS program, I seize this opportunity to practice front-end web development to create a final e-Portfolio.

In the following section, I wish to include a 3 minute video presentation providing a visual tour of the e-Portfolio:

### Body

The leadership and innovation goal showcases four artifacts. Each artifacts reinforce 4 ancillary goals that express my ability to engage and reflect on critical issues within librarianship and the information professional. I have selected these artifacts to clearly convey the core principles of the librarianship and the information profession: access, advocacy, intellectual freedom, literacy, equity, inclusion, and diversity. In addition, these artifacts situate these core principles between a macro perspective and a micro perspective of the library and information profession. One of the artifacts consist of an analysis of a patron behavior policy for public library. Furthermore, this anaylsis is instrumental in understanding how a written policy to promotes or hinders access, equity, inclusion, or diversity within a public library. Through these artifacts, I strive to demonstrate how librarians and information professionals can utilize these tools to advocate for their patrons, while also conveying the relevance and necessity of libraries in our society. 

### Conclusion

As a Technical Services Librarian, with over 10 years of practical library experience, the MLIS degree has facilitated me with a solid theoretical foundation. With this foundation, I have been able to create an e-Portfolio that expresses the ultimate culmination of my learning outcomes. These learning outcomes relate to being a steward of the profession, a facilitator of services, a communicator of ideas, and an effective researcher and anaylsis of diverse knowledge or ideas. As I reflect on my progress, throughout the MLIS program, I clearly detect how my professional experiences informed my course selection and my co-curricular activities. As a working professional and graduate student, I utilized the MLIS program to fill-in any gaps or deficiencies in my practical or professional experience.
