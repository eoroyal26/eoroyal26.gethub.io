## My Personal and Professional Journey

### Introduction

My initial introduction to the field of librarianship was purely driven by necessity. As a high school student, I accepted a part-time job at an academic library to assist my family. Therefore, I worked at this academic library after high school assisting students and faculty at the Circulation Desk and providing audio-visual support. While I initially had other career goals, I gradually become enamored with the profession. Overtime, I cultivated meaning mentorship relationships with librarians who were kind enough to share their many years of experiences and encourage me to pursue a career in library science. While completing my Bachelor of Arts in English, I continued to work at the same academic library as a Technical Services Assistant.

After graduation, I left the academic library after ten years of service and I accepted a position as an Admissions Counselor and Marketing Assistant. While this position was fulfilling, the Associate Director of the academic library encouraged me to accept a paraprofessional position as Cataloging and Database Specialist. This was an exciting opportunity because I developed hands-on skills with cataloging, classifying, and maintaining print and digital records to ensure a high degree of accessibility and discoverability. Because the Technical Services Librarian vacated the position, I was quickly promoted to this position, where I embraced new administrative responsibilities. While my initial exposure to the field of librarianship was driven by necessity, I soon developed a profound commitment to the profession and its mission.

Currently, I genuinely enjoy connecting students, faculty, staff, and the overall community with knowledge that supports and facilitates learning and research. Because connection is such a vital component of my role, I have also enjoyed developing processes and procedures to improve the selection, acquisition, and maintenance of print and digital resources. Therefore, a commitment to service drives me to inspire others by making meaning connections with people, thoughts, and ideas that support the library’s mission. My personal mission is to eliminate barriers to knowledge and ideas for students, faculty and staff by expanding access to information. Overall, I sincerely hope that this e-portfolio expresses my commitment the profession.

### Body

To reflect on the student learning outcomes, I have utilized these outcomes to organize the artifacts within my e-Portfolio. These student learning outcomes are significant because they encapsulate the learning objectives of the Master of Library and Information Science (MLIS) and the core competencies of the American Library Association. In addition, the artifacts trace my progress and ultimate completion of the 39 credit MLIS program. While simplicity, in design and user interface, is my objective in creating this e-Portfolio, I also want to create a e-Portfolio that communicates my professional development through a specific branding style that utilizes color selection, design principles, and a visual identity. In addition, I have utilized a GitHub template to build my working e-Portfolio during the first half of the MLIS program. Towards the second half of the MLIS program, I seize this opportunity to practice front-end web development to customize my final e-Portfolio.

The leadership and innovation goal showcases four artifacts. Each artifacts reinforce 4 ancillary goals that express my ability to engage and reflect on critical issues within librarianship and the information professional. I have selected these artifacts to clearly convey the core principles of the librarianship and the information profession: access, advocacy, intellectual freedom, literacy, equity, inclusion, and diversity. In addition, these artifacts situate these core principles within the overall mission of the library and information profession. One of the artifacts consist of a description of an emerging role within librarianship that transcends the traditional role of a librarian. This analysis is instrumental in understanding the rapid changes impacting the functions and services of the libraries. Through these artifacts, I strive to demonstrate how librarians and information professionals can utilize these tools to advocate for their patrons, while also conveying the relevance and necessity of libraries in our society.

### Conclusion

As Director for Collection Management Services, with over 10 years of practical library experience, the MLIS degree has facilitated me with a solid theoretical foundation. With this foundation, I have been able to create an e-Portfolio that expresses the ultimate culmination of my learning outcomes. These learning outcomes relate to being a steward of the profession, a facilitator of services, a communicator of ideas, and an effective researcher who analyzes diverse ideas. As I reflect on my progress, throughout the MLIS program, I clearly detect how my professional experiences informed my course selection and my co-curricular activities. As a working professional and graduate student, I utilized the MLIS program to fill-in any gaps or deficiencies in my practical or professional experience. Thank you for your time.

### Navigating the e-Portfolio

While striving to accomplish a minimal and a simple design, I have curated a series of navigational cues to guide you, the visitor, throughout my development as paraprofessional librarian, student of library studies, and professional librarian. Towards the bottom of the Home page, you can start your journey by clicking on the “View e-Portfolio” button to visit the e-Portfolio site. In addition, you may also select the hamburger menu icon to browse through the four primary pages: “Home,” “CV,” “E-Portfolio,” and “Tags.” Similarly, to the Home page, the other primary pages have active buttons to the e-Portfolio preview page. The e-Portfolio page consists of a series of hyperlinked rectangular tiles that contain images. These thumbnails direct you to the secondary pages. These pages contain the artifacts, the goals and the outcomes of the MLIS degree. Throughout each secondary page, you can toggle back and forth with the “next” and “previous” link near the footer of each page.
