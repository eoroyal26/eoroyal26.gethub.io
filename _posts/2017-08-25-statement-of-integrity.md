As a commitment to professional integrity, honor, and ethics, I affirm that I have prepared all artifacts, narratives, reflections, and examples within this e-Portfolio. In addition, I am committed to safeguarding the information in this e-Portfolio by utilizing safe encryption practices and safe internet practices. I have deliberately organized and approved, in collaboration with my advisor, the application of publicly accessible sites for the use of potential job searches or for public access to my professional portfolio or webpage. Furthermore, I respect the privacy of cited individuals, such as internship supervisors, interviewees, institutions, or contributors who provide information and support, by modifying and removing information that could be used to identify them.
