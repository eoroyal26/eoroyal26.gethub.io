### Goal IV: Students have a critical grounding in theoretical perspectives that draw on research in LIS as well as other fields of knowledge, that inform their professional practices including research, organization, management, and access to information.

## Goal IV(a). 
Students will describe applications of quantitative and qualitative research methodologies in library and information science.

As part of a group assignment, I assisted my fellow colleagues situating our research proposal within the context of qualitative research. With a qualitative approach, we utilized grounded theory to ensure validity and reliability throughout the study. While we weighted our options between quantitative and qualitative methodologies, our group chose a qualitative methodology. We all decided that a qualitative methodology was more appropriate in studying the personal experiences of students in relation to Chatbot technology on campus. With a suitable population size and sample, we proposed the utilization of a collaborative analysis software, NVivo, to breakdown data and extract valuable datasets study trends and patterns within the data.

## Goal IV(b). 
Students will identify opportunities for research and develop plans for research in applied settings in library and information science.
