### Goal IV: Students have a critical grounding in theoretical perspectives that draw on research in LIS as well as other fields of knowledge, that inform their professional practices including research, organization, management, and access to information.

## Goal IV(a). 
Students will describe applications of quantitative and qualitative research methodologies in library and information science.

<p><b>LIS 6271 Research Methods for Library and Information Science (Core Course).</b><br/><a href="https://eoroyal26.github.io/assets/pdf/Research-Propsoal_Group-Assignment_pwp.pdf" target="blank">Research Proposal: Assessment of User Experience with USF Library's Website Chatbot</a><br/><small>Password Required</small></p>

As part of a group assignment, I assisted my fellow colleagues situating our research proposal within the context of qualitative research. With a qualitative approach, we utilized grounded theory to ensure validity and reliability throughout the study. While we weighted our options between quantitative and qualitative methodologies, our group chose a qualitative methodology. We all decided that a qualitative methodology was more appropriate in studying the personal experiences of students in relation to Chatbot technology on campus. With a suitable population size and sample, we proposed the utilization of a collaborative analysis software, NVivo, to breakdown data and extract valuable datasets study trends and patterns within the data.

## Goal IV(b). 
Students will identify opportunities for research and develop plans for research in applied settings in library and information science. 

<p><b>LIS 6409 Introduction to Administration (Core Course).</b><br/><a href="https://eoroyal26.github.io/assets/pdf/Annotated-Bibliography-LSP-Migrations_v1.pdf" target="blank">Annotated Bibliography: Managing the Migration of a Library Services Platform</a></p>

This assignment focuses on the identification of research opportunities and the development of research application. More precisely, this assignment consists of an annotated bibliography that focuses on how libraries manage change throughout the migration to a new library service platform (LSP), which were previous known integrated library systems (ILS). I reviewed articles that highlighted the latest debates and discussions surrounding the best processes and procedures to manage a LSP migrations from premier scholars and researchers. Consequently, this annotation bibliography sets the foundation for a research paper that utilizes a special library as a unique case study. Because I recently managed the LSP migration within a special library, I used this assignment to conduct a strategic scan of the latest literature on this topic. After reviewing these articles, I realized that no research focused on LSP migrations for special libraries within the United States. Ultimately, I would like to use this assignment to begin a research paper focusing on a special library as a case study.
