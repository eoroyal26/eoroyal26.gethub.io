Goal II: Students understand the systems and technologies that facilitate the management and use of information resources to serve the diverse needs of users.

# Goal II(a).
Students identify and analyze diverse information needs of individuals and communities.

<p><b>LIS 6511 Collection Development (Core Course).</b><br/><a href="https://eoroyal26.github.io/assets/pdf/Collection_Development_Policy_2023_ER7.pdf" target="blank">Collection Development Policy and Community Profile</a></p>

With this artifact, I accomplished my goals of recognizing and examining the varied information needs of individuals and communities within the context of a collection development policy and a community profile. Therefore, I analyzed and identified the information needs of a law library by analyzing the effectiveness, quality, relevance, and scope of the collection’s subject fields, formats, and collection maps. By mapping the collection, I recommended specific actions that addressed collection maintenance, weeding policies, and evaluation procedures to address the needs of the library’s population. By analyzing and identifying these elements, I was able to compare the composition of the collection with the individuals within the community. While Collection Development Policy documents are created within groups, I decided to created a policy to understand how the various components relate to each other to create a comprehensive policy. 


# Goal II(b). 
Students evaluate and select print and digital information resources and systems to meet the needs of users.

<p><b>LIS 6603 Basic Information Sources and Services (Core Course).</b><br/><a href="https://law-stu.libguides.com/research-study-guide-lsp-migrations" target="blank">Research/Subject LibGuide: Library Services Platform (LSP) Migration.</a></p>

With the aim of selecting and evaluating resources to meet the needs of academic librarians and students, I utilized a technological platform to create a subject guide through LibGuides. This subject guide could serve as a resource to guide academic librarians and academic law librarians through a Library Services Platform (LSP) migration. In addition, this subject guide may asssit students and faculty who would like to incorporate this research topic within their academic coursework. Because I am currently in the post-implementation stage of a LSP migration, I will share these resources with my fellow colleagues within my academic law library. These resources are invaluable because they convey the experiences and opinions of other librarians who have also experienced a migration to a new LSP. While LSP migrations can be daunting and challenging, migrations can be extremely exciting because we may contribute to transforming the organization’s structure, workflows, functions, and resilience.

# Goal II(c). 
Students understand and use appropriate information technology for information services.

<p><b>LIS 6455 Organization and Administration of School Media Center (Elective Course).</b><br/><a href="https://sites.google.com/view/virtual-library-collection/home" target="blank">Virtual Library Collection: Norland Middle School</a></p>

With the Art Corner: Virtual Library Collection, I created a digital collection of ten electronic resources suitable for students from sixth grade to eighth grade. Furthermore, I selected digital resources that adhered to the context of a case study public school and to the State of Florida’s official information standards course descriptions for public schools within the state. In addition, I created a website to provide a description of the resources, and brief description of state standards, and access to the resources. Because I created this artifact in collaboration with a School Library Media Specialist, I utilized accessible tools that can be easily implemented by an instructor with little to no coding skills.
